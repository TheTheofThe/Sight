          <p style='font-family:sans-serif'>The iPad pro is Apple's <strong> Most Advanced iPad</strong> it is made for people of the workforce who need a <strong>more advanced device to preform extreme tasks</strong>but it is also the best iPad for artists. </p>
          
<p style='font-family:sans-serif'> The iPad pro comes in <strong> two sizes, both manufactured for different purposes</strong> the <strong>11 inch model is made for users who want an iPad Pro, but will use it as a '<em>couch surfer</em>' and not really preforming laptop-like tasks</strong></p>

<p style='font-family:sans-serif'>Moreover, the <strong>12.9 inch iPad pro is basically a touchscreen laptop,</strong>considering that Apple's original Macbook <strong>also had a screen size of 12.9 inches</strong> this iPad is great for <strong> artists, the frame rate, display and overall experience is unparallel to the 11 inch model as the screen is substantally bigger</strong></p>
